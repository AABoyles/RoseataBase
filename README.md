The Rosetta Stone between

Here's the Idea: You give it a Spreadsheet (or a database file).  It writes it into a SQLite Database, which you can then query and export as whatever filetype you want.

## HOW DO I USE IT?

### Loading Files

### Querying

### Exporting

## WHAT MAKES IT?

 * [SQL.js](http://kripken.github.io/sql.js/) makes it possible
 * [SheetJS](https://github.com/SheetJS/) makes it Excel-compatible
 * [JQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com) makes it pretty
 * [Tony Boyles](http://aaboyles.com) makes it
